Project Description
---
Create a fully functional front-­‐end (no database or server connectivity needed) with a clear purpose and correctly executed markup, CSS and JS. The goal is to design for mobile. It can be a mobile first responsive design, mobile only or a native app for Android and other platforms (iOS is tricky because it demands a developer licence). Design will not be rated still I suggest you design it carefully. You may not use a CMS (Wordpress etc) for this part. It should be your own HTML and CSS. However you may use predefined Javascript Libraries such as jQueryMobile.

### Presentation

1. Post a link to your app in Pingpong-­‐ Discussions-­‐ Project. Write down the names of all group members. Attach the documentation as well.
